## Introduction to Linux

Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the worldâ€™s smartphones are powered by Linux.

However, newcomers to Linux may find it somewhat difficult to approach, as Linux filesystems have a different structure than those found on Windows or MacOS. Additionally, Linux-based operating systems depend heavily on working with the command line interface, while most personal computers rely on graphical interfaces.

Linux borrows heavily from the UNIX operating system because it was written to be a free and open source version of UNIX. Files are stored in a hierarchical filesystem, with the top node of the system being root or simply "/". 

Whenever possible, Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects, and can often be worked with using the same utilities used for regular files.

Linux is a fully multitasking (a method where multiple tasks are performed during the same period of time), multiuser operating system, with built-in networking and service processes known as daemons in the UNIX world. Linux was inspired by UNIX, but it is not UNIX.

**So, what is a Linux distribution and how does it relate to the Linux kernel?**



As illustrated below, the [Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org) is the core of a computer operating system. A full **Linux distribution** consists of the kernel plus a number of other software tools for file-related operations, user management, and software package management. Each of these tools provides a small part of the complete system. Each tool is often its own separate project, with its own developers working to perfect that piece of the system.

A vast variety of Linux distributions cater to different audiences and organizations depending on their specific needs. Large commercial organizations tend to favor the commercially supported distributions from Red Hat, SUSE and Canonical (Ubuntu).

CentOS is a popular free alternative to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). Ubuntu and Fedora are popular in the educational realm. Scientific Linux is favored by the scientific research community for its compatibility with scientific and mathematical software packages. Both CentOS and Scientific Linux are binary-compatible with RHEL; i.e., binary software packages in most cases will install properly across the distributions.

Many commercial distributors, including Red Hat, Ubuntu, SUSE, and Oracle, provide long term fee-based support for their distributions, as well as hardware and software certification. All major distributors provide update services for keeping your system primed with the latest security and bug fixes, and performance enhancements, as well as provide online support resources.
