## Linux History 

Linux is a family of free and open-source operating systems based on the Linux kernel. Operating systems based on Linux are known as Linux distributions or distros. Examples include Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux, and many others.

The Linux kernel has been under active development since 1991, and has proven to be extremely versatile and adaptable. You can find computers that run Linux in a wide variety of contexts all over the world, from web servers to cell phones. Today, 90% of all cloud infrastructure and 74% of the worldâ€™s smartphones are powered by Linux.

## Prerequisites

To follow along you will need access to a server running a Linux-based operating system. Note that this fasthack was validated using a Linux server running Ubuntu 20.04 ([LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle)), but the examples given should work on any Linux distribution.
