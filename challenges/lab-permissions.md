1. As regular user (student), create a directory `~/permissions`.
2. Create a file called `myfile.txt` under `~permissions`.
3. List the properties of the file /var/log/waagent.log. Copy this file to your permissions directory. Who is the new owner of this file now?
4. As root, create a file called testfile.txt in the `/home/student/permissions` directory.
5. As regular user (student), look at who owns this file created by root.
6. Change the ownership of all files in `/home/student/permissions` to yourself (student).
7. Make sure you (student) have all rights to files within `~`, and others can only read
