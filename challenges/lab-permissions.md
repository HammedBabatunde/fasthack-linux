## Objectives

1. As regular user, create a directory `~/permissions`.
2. Copy a file owned by root from `/etc/` to your permissions dir, who owns this file now?
3. As root, create a file in the users `~/permissions` directory.
4. As normal user, look at who owns this file created by root.
5. Change the ownership of all files in `~/permissions` to yourself.
6. Make sure you have all rights to files within `~`, and others can only read
