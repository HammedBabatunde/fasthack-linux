# Control operators

## Objectives

1. Echo **it worked** when **touch test** works, and echo **it failed** when the **touch** failed. All on one command line as a normal user (not root). Test this line in your home directory and in `/bin/` 
2. Execute **sleep 60** in background (do no wait for it to finish)
3. Write a command line that executes **rm ~/file1**. Your command line should print '**success**' if file is removed, and print '**failed**' if there was a problem.
4. When you type passwd, which file is executed?
5. What kind of file is that?
